# Project 1
### Problem A: Git
Follow these steps in order:
* **Clone** this repo (lets-learn) to your local machine
* Create a **branch** on this repo called 'jake/master'
* In Explorer, navigate to this repository's folder
* Create a .txt file with the name and contents of your choice 
* Commit this change to the repo using GitHub Desktop
* At this point, you've only made changes to your branch. Now you'll want to make changes to the master branch by submitting a pull request. You can do this using GitHub Desktop and your soon-to-be-learned skill of Google Fu.
* After submitting the PR, you can move on to Problem B. Even if I haven't merged the Pull Request, you'll be able to make further commits to your branch that will then be merged when the PR is approved.

## Problem B: Jupyter
* Install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
* [Open jupyter](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html)
* In Jupyter, navigate to this repository's folder
* Create a Notebook in this folder called `jakes_answer.ipynb` (/lets-learn/p1/jakes_answer.ipynb)
* Create a markdown cell and another cell below it: `(Esc then m then b)`
* In the markdown cell, make a title and a description. You can copy in the following code, then hit `shift+enter` to make it print in printed markdown format. If you want to change the text, just double click on the cell and you'll be able to edit it.
```
# Title
Description
```
* To show me that you've done this, commit this change. If your branch has been merged, copy your file to your Desktop or somewhere safe, create a new branch, then commit to that branch.

## Problem C: Math
* Complete the problem described [here](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1) using the Python programming language in the Jupyter Notebook you created earlier in Problem B.  
  * You'll probably have to use for loops.
  * There's several ways to do this. If you get stuck or have another idea, just copy what you have into a new cell and work again from there. It's fine to have 5+ messy cells before you figure out which idea works best.
* Change the answer below to the number you got from your program
* **Commit** these changes to the repo
* **Push** the changes to the remote repository (still on your branch)
* Submit a **pull request** to merge your branch 'jake/master' with the root master 'master'

Answer here: *replace with answer*

This should take you about an hour or two. Call me if you have any questions.

Have fun!
